The worldwide spread of Covid-19 caused a nationwide lockdown in India from 24th
March 2020 and was further extended up to 31st May 2020 to break off the transmission 
of novel Corona virus. The COVID-19 vaccine was launched in India on 16th January, 2021. 
In this project I aim to forecast when the whole vaccination process might end for West 
Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Delhi. The available date is from 16th
January 2021 to 9th May 2021.
