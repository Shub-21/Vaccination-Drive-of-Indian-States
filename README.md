##Vaccination 
The worldwide spread of Covid-19 caused a nationwide lockdown in India from 24th
March 2020 and was further extended up to 31st May 2020 to break off the transmission 
of novel Corona virus. The COVID-19 vaccine was launched in India on 16th January, 2021. 
In this project I aim to forecast when the whole vaccination process might end for West 
Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Delhi. The available date is from 16th
January 2021 to 9th May 2021.
By Exploratory Analysis I intend to see comparative Vaccination drive for the 5 
States. And I found out that the Vaccination drive is high in the state of Maharashtra 
followed by Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala and Delhi. The Covishield production is 
higher compared to the Covaxin production. And the total male individual vaccinated is 
more than the female and transgender individual in every state except the Kerala.
I have used time series forecasting method to forecast the estimated date of 
ending of vaccination drive.
Through my findings I can say that the nationwide vaccination might end near 
between September and November of 2022. But that is a hypothetical fact based on these 
5 States i.e. the nationwide Vaccination might end earlier or later the given period.
